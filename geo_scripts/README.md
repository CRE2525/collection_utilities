# geo_scripts
This script goes through the csv and gets the coordinates of all the addresses. If there is no specific address present, it goes to the
next location available (city, province country etc.) You can run it normally by pressing f5, but you need the csv in the same folder
and it has to be the name specified in the script, in pandas.read_excel line (line 40)
